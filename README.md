# Kukiku Error Pages

Welcome to the Kukiku Error Pages repository! These error pages, crafted by Julian, are freely available for use. Originally designed for kukiku.org, they cover a range of HTTP status codes to enhance the user experience during error situations. While some may consider most of these pages useless, Julian takes pride in creating error pages for various scenarios, sometimes even for things that don't exist.

## Overview

This repository includes error pages for the following HTTP status codes:
